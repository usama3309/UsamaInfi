# Ready to Join Our Team?

We are thrilled that you’re interested in joining our team! To help us evaluate whether your skills align with what we are looking for, we have prepared a set of assignments designed to challenge your problem-solving abilities, technical expertise, and creativity.

These exercises are not only an opportunity for us to learn about you but also for you to showcase your approach to tackling real-world problems.

## What You Need to Do

There are two key steps required to complete your application:

1. **Fill out the Hiring Questions**  
   Start by answering a set of questions to give us a better understanding of your availability, qualifications, and preferences. You can find the questions in the file:  
   [hiring-questions.md](./hiring-questions.md)  

2. **Complete the Programming Test**  
   The programming test contains several exercises that help us assess your technical knowledge and problem-solving skills. You can find the test in the file:  
   [programming-test.md](./programming-test.md)  

Both files are located in the root of this repository. Please make sure to review them carefully.

## How to Submit Your Work

We encourage you to approach the assignments in the way that best reflects your skills and working style. There are no strict rules for submission, but here are some recommendations:

- **Git Usage (Bonus Points)**:  
  Using Git to organize and submit your work is always a big plus. It demonstrates your ability to work in a version-controlled environment and aligns with how we collaborate as a team.  
  - Fork this repository (make it private), create a branch for your solutions, and send us the link to your fork.
     - NOTE: do not create a pull request to avoid others being able to view your answers.
  - Alternatively, you can create a separate repository in your own GitHub account and share the link with us.

- **Alternative Methods**:  
  If you're not familiar with Git or prefer not to use it, you can submit your answers in other ways, such as sharing a ZIP file or emailing your work directly to us.

## What We Value

We’re not just interested in the final results — we want to see **how you think** and **how you approach problems**. Here are some things we value in submissions:

- **Clarity and Structure**: Solutions that are well-organized and easy to understand.  
- **Maintainability**: Code and answers that demonstrate clean, modular, and maintainable practices.  
- **Creativity**: Innovative approaches that go beyond the minimum requirements.  
- **Git Proficiency** *(optional)*: Using Git effectively to manage your work is a bonus.
